# Nest Doorbell Gen 3 Custom Wedge

This custom Nest Doorbell Gen 3 wedge is designed for the latest __"Generation 3"__ model and intended to mount on the left-hand surface when facing the door. The "yaw" angle from the surface normal is 50° to the right, and 10° pitched-up. I recommend using at least 1.5" [Tapcon](https://www.tapcon.com) concrete anchor screws for the mounting hardware.

* [wedge_5_cura.3mf](./3mf/wedge_5_cura.3mf) is the main body
* [plug_top.3mf](./3mf/plug_top.3mf) is the plug for the top mount screw hole
